In 2022, Lisa Marie Presley asked her daughter to help finally finish her long-gestating memoir. A month later, Lisa Marie was dead, and the world would never know her story in her own words, never know the passionate, joyful, caring, and complicated woman that Riley loved and now grieved. Riley got the tapes that her mother had recorded for the book, lay in her bed, and listened as Lisa Marie told story after story about smashing golf carts together in the yards of Graceland, about the unconditional love she felt from her father, about being upstairs, just the two of them. About getting dragged screaming out of the bathroom as she ran toward his body on the floor. About living in Los Angeles with her mother, getting sent to school after school, always kicked out, always in trouble. About her singular, lifelong relationship with Danny Keough, about being married to Michael Jackson, what they had in common. About motherhood. About deep addiction. About ever-present grief. Riley knew she had to fulfill her mother’s wish to reveal these memories, incandescent and painful, to the world. To make her mother known. This extraordinary book is written in both Lisa Marie’s and Riley’s voices, a mother and daughter communicating—from this world to the one beyond—as they try to heal each other. Profoundly moving and deeply revealing, From Here to the Great Unknown is a book like no other—the last words of the only child of an American icon.",['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81wThrp1YyL._SY522_.jpg'],2,Books > Self-Help > Death & Grief,https://www.amazon.com/-/dp/0593733878?_encoding=UTF8&th=1&psc=1&pf_rd_i=desktop&ref_=pd_gw_unk,Hardcover,,,,"{'Publisher': 'Random House (October 8, 2024)', 'Language': 'English', 'Hardcover': '304 pages', 'ISBN-10': '0593733878', 'ISBN-13': '978-0593733875', 'Item Weight': '2.31 pounds', 'Dimensions': '5.75 x 1.05 x 8.54 inches', 'Amazon Best Sellers Rank': '#2 in Books , #1 in Love & Loss , #2 in Memoirs (Books) , #2 in Actor & Entertainer Biographies'}",0593733878,[],{},new,"[{'title': 'Melania', 'link': 'https://www.amazon.com/Melania-Trump/dp/1510782699/ref=pd_bxgy_d_sccl_1/000-0000000-0000000?pd_rd_w=3jO1R&content-id=amzn1.sym.3858a394-39a9-4946-90e6-86a3153d2546&pf_rd_p=3858a394-39a9-4946-90e6-86a3153d2546&pf_rd_r=APCJWZG5YXF61AA7WFJB&pd_rd_wg=kGVls&pd_rd_r=a53c7f5b-7cde-420f-97f0-1cd8b90836d7&pd_rd_i=1510782699&psc=1', 'price': '$28.00'}, {'title': 'Be Ready When the Luck Happens: A Memoir', 'link': 'https://www.amazon.com/Be-Ready-When-Luck-Happens/dp/0593799895/ref=pd_bxgy_d_sccl_2/000-0000000-0000000?pd_rd_w=3jO1R&content-id=amzn1.sym.3858a394-39a9-4946-90e6-86a3153d2546&pf_rd_p=3858a394-39a9-4946-90e6-86a3153d2546&pf_rd_r=APCJWZG5YXF61AA7WFJB&pd_rd_wg=kGVls&pd_rd_r=a53c7f5b-7cde-420f-97f0-1cd8b90836d7&pd_rd_i=0593799895&psc=1', 'price': '$21.00'}]",[],79%,14%,4%,2%,1%

War is an intimate and sweeping account of one of the most tumultuous periods in presidential politics and American history. We see President Joe Biden and his top advisers in tense conversations with Russian president Vladimir Putin, Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky. We also see Donald Trump, conducting a shadow presidency and seeking to regain political power. With unrivaled, inside-the-room reporting, Woodward shows President Biden’s approach to managing the war in Ukraine, the most significant land war in Europe since World War II, and his tortured path to contain the bloody Middle East conflict between Israel and the terrorist group Hamas. Woodward reveals the extraordinary complexity and consequence of wartime back-channel diplomacy and decision-making to deter the use of nuclear weapons and a rapid slide into World War III. The raw cage-fight of politics accelerates as Americans prepare to vote in 2024, starting between President Biden and Trump, and ending with the unexpected elevation of Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee for president. War provides an unvarnished examination of the vice president as she tries to embrace the Biden legacy and policies while beginning to chart a path of her own as a presidential candidate.

I only try on one of Nina’s pristine white dresses once. Just to see what it’s like.

These pilgrimages, for him, help ground his powerful writing about race.”—Associated Press “Coates exhorts readers, including students, parents, educators, and journalists, to challenge conventional narratives that can be used to justify ethnic cleansing or camouflage racist policing. Brilliant and timely.”— Booklist (starred review) Ta-Nehisi Coates originally set out to write a book about writing, in the tradition of Orwell’s classic “Politics and the English Language,” but found himself grappling with deeper questions about how our stories—our reporting and imaginative narratives and mythmaking—expose and distort our realities. In the first of the book’s three intertwining essays, Coates, on his first trip to Africa, finds himself in two places at once: in Dakar, a modern city in Senegal, and in a mythic kingdom in his mind. Then he takes readers along with him to Columbia, South Carolina, where he reports on his own book’s banning, but also explores the larger backlash to the nation’s recent reckoning with history and the deeply rooted American mythology so visible in that city—a capital of the Confederacy with statues of segregationists looming over its public squares. Finally, in the book’s longest section, Coates travels to Palestine, where he sees with devastating clarity how easily we are misled by nationalist narratives, and the tragedy that lies in the clash between the stories we tell and the reality of life on the ground. Written at a dramatic moment in American and global life, this work from one of the country’s most important writers is about the urgent need to untangle ourselves from the destructive myths that shape our world—and our own souls—and embrace the liberating power of even the most difficult truths.",['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91ZSMtvdM3L._SY522_.jpg'],0,Books > History > Americas,https://www.amazon.com/-/dp/0593230388?_encoding=UTF8&th=1&psc=1&pf_rd_i=desktop&ref_=pd_gw_unk,Hardcover,,,,"{'Publisher': 'One World (October 1, 2024)', 'Language': 'English', 'Hardcover': '256 pages', 'ISBN-10': '0593230388', 'ISBN-13': '978-0593230381', 'Item Weight': '2.31 pounds', 'Dimensions': '5.25 x 0.9 x 7.76 inches', 'Amazon Best Sellers Rank': '#6 in Books , #1 in U.S. State & Local History , #1 in Black & African American Biographies , #2 in Discrimination & Racism'}",0593230388,[],{},new,"[{'title': 'Between the World and Me', 'link': 'https://www.amazon.com/Between-World-Me-Ta-Nehisi-Coates/dp/0812993543/ref=pd_bxgy_d_sccl_1/000-0000000-0000000?pd_rd_w=F0Iqn&content-id=amzn1.sym.3858a394-39a9-4946-90e6-86a3153d2546&pf_rd_p=3858a394-39a9-4946-90e6-86a3153d2546&pf_rd_r=E3JG57PC4QHYZH9VHMGA&pd_rd_wg=SxtAK&pd_rd_r=079d4401-46fb-4a68-8304-0bfce1d30845&pd_rd_i=0812993543&psc=1', 'price': '$11.99'}, {'title': 'We Were Eight Years in Power: An American Tragedy', 'link': 'https://www.amazon.com/We-Were-Eight-Years-Power/dp/0399590579/ref=pd_bxgy_d_sccl_2/000-0000000-0000000?pd_rd_w=F0Iqn&content-id=amzn1.sym.3858a394-39a9-4946-90e6-86a3153d2546&pf_rd_p=3858a394-39a9-4946-90e6-86a3153d2546&pf_rd_r=E3JG57PC4QHYZH9VHMGA&pd_rd_wg=SxtAK&pd_rd_r=079d4401-46fb-4a68-8304-0bfce1d30845&pd_rd_i=0399590579&psc=1', 'price': '$10.99'}]","[{'badge': 'Amazon Charts', 'badge_text': '#1 this week'}]",80%,8%,1%,1%,10%

A bold new vision for optimizing our health now and in the future What if depression, anxiety, infertility, insomnia, heart disease, erectile dysfunction, type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer’s, dementia, cancer and many other health conditions that torture and shorten our lives actually have the same root cause? Our ability to prevent and reverse these conditions - and feel incredible today - is under our control and simpler than we think. The key is our metabolic function - the most important and least understood factor in our overall health. As Dr. Casey Means explains in this groundbreaking book, nearly every health problem we face can be explained by how well the cells in our body create and use energy. To live free from frustrating symptoms and life-threatening disease, we need our cells to be optimally powered so that they can create “good energy,” the essential fuel that impacts every aspect of our physical and mental wellbeing. If you are battling minor signals of “bad energy” inside your body, it is often a warning sign that more life-threatening illness may emerge later in life. But here’s the good news: for the first time ever, we can monitor our metabolic health in great detail and learn how to improve it ourselves. Weaving together cutting-edge research and personal stories, as well as groundbreaking data from the health technology company Dr. Means founded, Good Energy offers an essential four-week plan and explains: The five biomarkers that determine your risk for a deadly disease. How to use inexpensive tools and technology to “see inside your body” and take action. Why dietary philosophies are designed to confuse us, and six lifelong food principles you can implement whether you’re carnivore or vegan. The crucial links between sleep, circadian rhythm, and metabolism A new framework for exercise focused on building simple movement into everyday activities How cold and heat exposure helps build our body’s resilience Steps to navigate the medical system to get what you need for optimal health Good Energy offers a new, cutting-edge understanding of the true cause of illness that until now has remained hidden.

Here, for the first time, Ina Garten presents an intimate, entertaining, and inspiring account of her remarkable journey. Ina’s gift is to make everything look easy, yet all her accomplishments have been the result of hard work, audacious choices, and exquisite attention to detail. In her unmistakable voice (no one tells a story like Ina), she brings her past and her process to life in a high-spirited and no-holds-barred memoir that chronicles decades of personal challenges, adventures (and misadventures) and unexpected career twists, all delivered with her signature combination of playfulness and purpose. From a difficult childhood to meeting the love of her life, Jeffrey, and marrying him while still in college, from a boring bureaucratic job in Washington, D.C., to answering an ad for a specialty food store in the Hamptons, from the owner of one Barefoot Contessa shop to author of bestselling cookbooks and celebrated television host, Ina has blazed her own trail and, in the meantime, taught millions of people how to cook and entertain.

The shift in kids’ energy and attention from the physical world to the virtual one, Haidt shows, has been catastrophic, especially for girls.” —Michelle Goldberg, The New York Times After more than a decade of stability or improvement, the mental health of adolescents plunged in the early 2010s. Rates of depression, anxiety, self-harm, and suicide rose sharply, more than doubling on many measures. Why? In The Anxious Generation , social psychologist Jonathan Haidt lays out the facts about the epidemic of teen mental illness that hit many countries at the same time. He then investigates the nature of childhood, including why children need play and independent exploration to mature into competent, thriving adults. Haidt shows how the “play-based childhood” began to decline in the 1980s, and how it was finally wiped out by the arrival of the “phone-based childhood” in the early 2010s. He presents more than a dozen mechanisms by which this “great rewiring of childhood” has interfered with children’s social and neurological development, covering everything from sleep deprivation to attention fragmentation, addiction, loneliness, social contagion, social comparison, and perfectionism. He explains why social media damages girls more than boys and why boys have been withdrawing from the real world into the virtual world, with disastrous consequences for themselves, their families, and their societies. Most important, Haidt issues a clear call to action. He diagnoses the “collective action problems” that trap us, and then proposes four simple rules that might set us free. He describes steps that parents, teachers, schools, tech companies, and governments can take to end the epidemic of mental illness and restore a more humane childhood. Haidt has spent his career speaking truth backed by data in the most difficult landscapes—communities polarized by politics and religion, campuses battling culture wars, and now the public health emergency faced by Gen Z. We cannot afford to ignore his findings about protecting our children—and ourselves—from the psychological damage of a phone-based life.",['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81XP4hEXDXL._SY522_.jpg'],10,Books > Parenting & Relationships > Parenting,https://www.amazon.com/-/dp/0593655036?_encoding=UTF8&th=1&psc=1&pf_rd_i=desktop&ref_=pd_gw_unk,Hardcover,,,,"{'Publisher': 'Penguin Press (March 26, 2024)', 'Language': 'English', 'Hardcover': '400 pages', 'ISBN-10': '0593655036', 'ISBN-13': '978-0593655030', 'Item Weight': '1.2 pounds', 'Dimensions': '6.31 x 1.26 x 9.53 inches', 'Amazon Best Sellers Rank': '#12 in Books , #1 in Teen & Young Adult Books , #2 in Parenting Teenagers (Books) , #2 in Stress Management Self-Help'}",0593655036,[],{},new,"[{'title': 'The Coddling of the American Mind: How Good Intentions and Bad Ideas Are Setting Up a Generation for Failure', 'link': 'https://www.amazon.com/Coddling-American-Mind-Intentions-Generation/dp/0735224919/ref=pd_bxgy_d_sccl_1/000-0000000-0000000?pd_rd_w=P2oiU&content-id=amzn1.sym.3858a394-39a9-4946-90e6-86a3153d2546&pf_rd_p=3858a394-39a9-4946-90e6-86a3153d2546&pf_rd_r=VFPBDWFMAPT37Z46ZGY9&pd_rd_wg=hbUr8&pd_rd_r=d86a93a5-db61-4da1-b106-977f63e22c66&pd_rd_i=0735224919&psc=1', 'price': '$12.99'}, {'title': ""Bad Therapy: Why the Kids Aren't Growing Up"", 'link': 'https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Therapy-Kids-Arent-Growing/dp/0593542924/ref=pd_bxgy_d_sccl_2/000-0000000-0000000?pd_rd_w=P2oiU&content-id=amzn1.sym.3858a394-39a9-4946-90e6-86a3153d2546&pf_rd_p=3858a394-39a9-4946-90e6-86a3153d2546&pf_rd_r=VFPBDWFMAPT37Z46ZGY9&pd_rd_wg=hbUr8&pd_rd_r=d86a93a5-db61-4da1-b106-977f63e22c66&pd_rd_i=0593542924&psc=1', 'price': '$26.55'}]","[{'badge': 'Amazon Charts', 'badge_text': '#3 this week'}]",75%,18%,5%,1%,1%

Over 20 million copies sold! Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results No matter your goals, Atomic Habits offers a proven framework for improving--every day. James Clear, one of the world's leading experts on habit formation, reveals practical strategies that will teach you exactly how to form good habits, break bad ones, and master the tiny behaviors that lead to remarkable results. If you're having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn't you. The problem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don't want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change. You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems. Here, you'll get a proven system that can take you to new heights. Clear is known for his ability to distill complex topics into simple behaviors that can be easily applied to daily life and work. Here, he draws on the most proven ideas from biology, psychology, and neuroscience to create an easy-to-understand guide for making good habits inevitable and bad habits impossible. Along the way, readers will be inspired and entertained with true stories from Olympic gold medalists, award-winning artists, business leaders, life-saving physicians, and star comedians who have used the science of small habits to master their craft and vault to the top of their field. Learn how to: make time for new habits (even when life gets crazy); overcome a lack of motivation and willpower; design your environment to make success easier; get back on track when you fall off course; ...and much more. Atomic Habits will reshape the way you think about progress and success, and give you the tools and strategies you need to transform your habits--whether you are a team looking to win a championship, an organization hoping to redefine an industry, or simply an individual who wishes to quit smoking, lose weight, reduce stress, or achieve any other goal.",['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81ANaVZk5LL._SY522_.jpg'],10,"Books > Health, Fitness & Dieting > Psychology & Counseling",https://www.amazon.com/-/dp/0735211299?_encoding=UTF8&th=1&psc=1&pf_rd_i=desktop&ref_=pd_gw_unk,Hardcover,,,,"{'Publisher': 'Avery; First Edition (October 16, 2018)', 'Language': 'English', 'Hardcover': '320 pages', 'ISBN-10': '0735211299', 'ISBN-13': '978-0735211292', 'Item Weight': '1.13 pounds', 'Dimensions': '6.28 x 1.07 x 9.27 inches', 'Amazon Best Sellers Rank': '#19 in Books , #2 in Personal Transformation Self-Help , #3 in Parenting (Books) , #3 in Popular Social Psychology & Interactions'}",0735211299,[],{},new,"[{'title': 'The Psychology of Money: Timeless lessons on wealth, greed, and happiness', 'link': 'https://www.amazon.com/Psychology-Money-Timeless-lessons-happiness/dp/0857197681/ref=pd_bxgy_d_sccl_1/000-0000000-0000000?pd_rd_w=gjRjT&content-id=amzn1.sym.3858a394-39a9-4946-90e6-86a3153d2546&pf_rd_p=3858a394-39a9-4946-90e6-86a3153d2546&pf_rd_r=03ZVJN0N6YAAB2MBP0HM&pd_rd_wg=owV44&pd_rd_r=b2840913-20bf-4118-b3b0-73114669d0fd&pd_rd_i=0857197681&psc=1', 'price': '$9.34'}, {'title': 'The 48 Laws of Power', 'link': 'https://www.amazon.com/48-Laws-Power-Robert-Greene/dp/0140280197/ref=pd_bxgy_d_sccl_2/000-0000000-0000000?pd_rd_w=gjRjT&content-id=amzn1.sym.3858a394-39a9-4946-90e6-86a3153d2546&pf_rd_p=3858a394-39a9-4946-90e6-86a3153d2546&pf_rd_r=03ZVJN0N6YAAB2MBP0HM&pd_rd_wg=owV44&pd_rd_r=b2840913-20bf-4118-b3b0-73114669d0fd&pd_rd_i=0140280197&psc=1', 'price': '$14.55'}]","[{'badge': 'Amazon Charts', 'badge_text': '#1 this week'}]",83%,12%,3%,1%,1%
