YES, but practice focusing and examining flat objects first. A 3D object will work if placed near (but not inside) the bottom of microscope (clear part), but if you pre-focus the microscope on a flat object first, it will be much easier. I'm looking at an object like a stamp and image is upside down / reversed. Is that right? YES, most microscopes do this. For handheld microscopes, the optical system flips and reverses the image, while magnifying it. This allows for an affordable and compact design. The microscope isn't broken, that's just how a pocket microscope works What kind of things can I review with this microscope? The MicroBrite can examine a diverse range of subjects, such as fabric, grass, sand, hair, skin, bugs, stamps or even a pineapple or worm! You can even observe larger microorganisms like bacteria, blood, germs, paramecium and euglena! Can I use a smartphone with this microscope to take images and video? The MM-300 version does not have a smartphone adapter, but you can buy the MM-310 adapter separate to work with it OR you can buy the MM-350 that comes with both the microscope and the smartphone adapter. How do I get the best image when focusing with this portable microscope? Always practice focusing on a flat object at the lowest power setting. Slowly turn the knob until you get close to seeing a focused image. Then turn the knob extremely slowly to get the perfect focus. Then up the power setting and slightly refocus.","['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61vSr6zvmnL._AC_SL1500_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81zhTWbdpkL._AC_SL1500_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81nsYGolS1L._AC_SL1500_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81H0rantCSL._AC_SL1500_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71OJySGHsmL._AC_SL1500_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ZxbMRa2xL._AC_SL1500_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71S9MZmk1FL._AC_SL1500_.jpg']",10,Electronics > Camera & Photo > Binoculars & Scopes > Microscopes > Stereo Microscopes,https://www.amazon.com/-/dp/B00LAX52IQ?_encoding=UTF8&th=1&psc=1&pf_rd_i=desktop&ref_=pd_gw_unk,"size: 1, style: MicroBrite (MM-300)",1,,,"{'Manufacturer': 'Carson Optical, Inc', 'ASIN': 'B00LAX52IQ', 'UPC': '750668011176', 'Global Trade Identification Number': '00750668011176', 'Model Name': 'MM-300', 'Brand Name': 'Carson', 'Color': 'Black/gray', 'Material Type': 'Plastic', 'Item Weight': '0.13 Pounds', 'Item Dimensions L x W x H': '2.25""L x 1.2""W x 3.5""H', 'Compatible Devices': 'Smartphone', 'Voltage': '1.5 Volts', 'Power Source': 'Battery Powered', 'Objective Lens Description': 'Achromatic', 'Magnification Maximum': '120 x', 'Light Source Type': 'LED', 'Amazon Best Sellers Rank': '#3 in Camera & Photo Products , #1 in Lab Stereo Microscopes , #28 in Lab Instruments & Equipment'}",B0DDLGGLVM,"[{'size_name': '1', 'style_name': 'MicroBrite + Smartphone Clip (MM-350)', 'asin': 'B001448KT4'}, {'size_name': '1', 'style_name': 'Smartphone Clip (MM-310)', 'asin': 'B0BQRW5VFP'}, {'size_name': '1', 'style_name': 'MicroBrite (MM-300)', 'asin': 'B00LAX52IQ'}, {'size_name': '4', 'style_name': 'MicroBrite (MM-300)', 'asin': 'B00X5TNSCA'}, {'size_name': '4', 'style_name': 'MicroBrite + Smartphone Clip (MM-350)', 'asin': 'B0BR64MTVK'}]","{'size_name': ['1', '4'], 'style_name': ['MicroBrite (MM-300)', 'Smartphone Clip (MM-310)', 'MicroBrite + Smartphone Clip (MM-350)']}",new,"[{'title': 'ALKOO Case Compatible with Carson MicroBrite Plus 60x-120x LED Lighted Pocket Microscope, Carry Storage Holder for Kids Microscope (Grey)', 'link': 'https://www.amazon.com/Compatible-MicroBrite-60x-120x-Lighted-Microscope/dp/B07YFFFWY2/ref=pd_bxgy_d_sccl_1/000-0000000-0000000?pd_rd_w=PzyaS&content-id=amzn1.sym.3858a394-39a9-4946-90e6-86a3153d2546&pf_rd_p=3858a394-39a9-4946-90e6-86a3153d2546&pf_rd_r=B6EGB5JBBFZW7JQS12QQ&pd_rd_wg=L6Kwi&pd_rd_r=3d567ed8-a96f-4615-a2b3-dacabad6f861&pd_rd_i=B07YFFFWY2&psc=1', 'price': '$9.99'}, {'title': 'Jiusion 48Pcs Prepared Microscope Slides Specimen Animals Insects Plants Flowers Sample Biological Specimen, Stereo Microscope Slide for Kids Children Students Enlighten Education', 'link': 'https://www.amazon.com/Jiusion-Microscope-Biological-Enlighten-Education/dp/B078TFD6BQ/ref=pd_bxgy_d_sccl_2/000-0000000-0000000?pd_rd_w=PzyaS&content-id=amzn1.sym.3858a394-39a9-4946-90e6-86a3153d2546&pf_rd_p=3858a394-39a9-4946-90e6-86a3153d2546&pf_rd_r=B6EGB5JBBFZW7JQS12QQ&pd_rd_wg=L6Kwi&pd_rd_r=3d567ed8-a96f-4615-a2b3-dacabad6f861&pd_rd_i=B078TFD6BQ&psc=1', 'price': '$11.99'}]","[{'badge': ""Amazon's Choice"", 'badge_text': None}]",60%,16%,11%,5%,8%
