In 2022, Lisa Marie Presley asked her daughter to help finally finish her long-gestating memoir. A month later, Lisa Marie was dead, and the world would never know her story in her own words, never know the passionate, joyful, caring, and complicated woman that Riley loved and now grieved. Riley got the tapes that her mother had recorded for the book, lay in her bed, and listened as Lisa Marie told story after story about smashing golf carts together in the yards of Graceland, about the unconditional love she felt from her father, about being upstairs, just the two of them. About getting dragged screaming out of the bathroom as she ran toward his body on the floor. About living in Los Angeles with her mother, getting sent to school after school, always kicked out, always in trouble. About her singular, lifelong relationship with Danny Keough, about being married to Michael Jackson, what they had in common. About motherhood. About deep addiction. About ever-present grief. Riley knew she had to fulfill her mother’s wish to reveal these memories, incandescent and painful, to the world. To make her mother known. This extraordinary book is written in both Lisa Marie’s and Riley’s voices, a mother and daughter communicating—from this world to the one beyond—as they try to heal each other. Profoundly moving and deeply revealing, From Here to the Great Unknown is a book like no other—the last words of the only child of an American icon.",['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/814R5hw4vAL._SX522_.jpg'],0,Books > Self-Help > Death & Grief > Grief & Bereavement,https://www.amazon.com/-/dp/B0CRSDK1Q8?_encoding=UTF8&th=1&psc=1&pf_rd_i=desktop&ref_=pd_gw_unk,Audiobook,,,,"{'Listening Length': '5 hours and 42 minutes', 'Author': 'Lisa Marie Presley, Riley Keough', 'Narrator': 'Riley Keough, Julia Roberts', 'Whispersync for Voice': 'Ready', 'Audible.com Release Date': 'October 08, 2024', 'Publisher': 'Random House Audio', 'Program Type': 'Audiobook', 'Version': 'Unabridged', 'Language': 'English', 'ASIN': 'B0CRSDK1Q8', 'Amazon Best Sellers Rank': '#2 in Audible Books & Originals , #1 in Grief & Bereavement , #1 in Relationships (Audible Books & Originals) , #1 in Biographies of Celebrities & Entertainment Professionals'}",B0CRSDK1Q8,[],{},new,[],[],79%,14%,4%,2%,1%

These pilgrimages, for him, help ground his powerful writing about race.”—Associated Press “Coates exhorts readers, including students, parents, educators, and journalists, to challenge conventional narratives that can be used to justify ethnic cleansing or camouflage racist policing. Brilliant and timely.”— Booklist (starred review) Ta-Nehisi Coates originally set out to write a book about writing, in the tradition of Orwell’s classic “Politics and the English Language,” but found himself grappling with deeper questions about how our stories—our reporting and imaginative narratives and mythmaking—expose and distort our realities. In the first of the book’s three intertwining essays, Coates, on his first trip to Africa, finds himself in two places at once: in Dakar, a modern city in Senegal, and in a mythic kingdom in his mind. Then he takes listeners along with him to Columbia, South Carolina, where he reports on his own book’s banning, but also explores the larger backlash to the nation’s recent reckoning with history and the deeply rooted American mythology so visible in that city—a capital of the Confederacy with statues of segregationists looming over its public squares. Finally, in the book’s longest section, Coates travels to Palestine, where he sees with devastating clarity how easily we are misled by nationalist narratives, and the tragedy that lies in the clash between the stories we tell and the reality of life on the ground. Written at a dramatic moment in American and global life, this work from one of the country’s most important writers is about the urgent need to untangle ourselves from the destructive myths that shape our world—and our own souls—and embrace the liberating power of even the most difficult truths.",['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/A18t7l00mGL._SX522_.jpg'],0,Books > Politics & Social Sciences > Sociology > Race Relations > Discrimination & Racism,https://www.amazon.com/-/dp/B0D1D5FN2L?_encoding=UTF8&th=1&psc=1&pf_rd_i=desktop&ref_=pd_gw_unk,Audiobook,,,,"{'Listening Length': '5 hours and 20 minutes', 'Author': 'Ta-Nehisi Coates', 'Narrator': 'Ta-Nehisi Coates', 'Whispersync for Voice': 'Ready', 'Audible.com Release Date': 'October 01, 2024', 'Publisher': 'Random House Audio', 'Program Type': 'Audiobook', 'Version': 'Unabridged', 'Language': 'English', 'ASIN': 'B0D1D5FN2L', 'Amazon Best Sellers Rank': '#7 in Audible Books & Originals , #1 in Social Sciences (Books) , #1 in Discrimination & Racism , #1 in Racism & Discrimination Studies'}",B0D1D5FN2L,[],{},new,[],"[{'badge': 'Amazon Charts', 'badge_text': '#1 this week'}]",80%,8%,1%,1%,10%

A quarter-century after the publication of his groundbreaking first book, Malcolm Gladwell returns with a brand-new volume that reframes the lessons of The Tipping Point in a startling and revealing light — this time in an immersive audio format that transports you, the listener, directly inside of each riveting story. Why is Miami… Miami? What does the heartbreaking fate of the cheetah tell us about the way we raise our children? Why do Ivy League schools care so much about sports? What is the Magic Third, and what does it mean for racial harmony? In this provocative new work, Malcolm Gladwell returns to the subject of social epidemics and tipping points, this time with the aim of explaining the dark side of contagious phenomena. Through a series of gripping stories, Gladwell traces the rise of a new and troubling form of social engineering. As with his podcast Revisionist History and bestsellers Talking to Strangers and The Bomber Mafia , pressing play on this audiobook will bring each scene and story to life with vivid first-person accounts, captivating oral histories, illuminating moments from history past and present, and a cinematic original music score. Take to the streets of Los Angeles with Malcolm to meet the world’s most successful bank robbers, rediscover a forgotten television show from the 1970s that changed the world, visit the site of a historic experiment on a tiny cul-de-sac in northern California, and explore an alternate history of two of the biggest epidemics of our day: COVID and the opioid crisis. Revenge of the Tipping Point is Gladwell’s most personal book yet. With his characteristic mix of storytelling and social science, he offers a guide to making sense of the contagions of the modern world.

War is an intimate and sweeping account of one of the most tumultuous periods in presidential politics and American history. We see President Joe Biden and his top advisers in tense conversations with Russian president Vladimir Putin, Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky. We also see Donald Trump, conducting a shadow presidency and seeking to regain political power. With unrivaled, inside-the-room reporting, Woodward shows President Biden’s approach to managing the war in Ukraine, the most significant land war in Europe since World War II, and his tortured path to contain the bloody Middle East conflict between Israel and the terrorist group Hamas. Woodward reveals the extraordinary complexity and consequence of wartime back-channel diplomacy and decision-making to deter the use of nuclear weapons and a rapid slide into World War III. The raw cage-fight of politics accelerates as Americans prepare to vote in 2024, starting between President Biden and Trump, and ending with the unexpected elevation of Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee for president. War provides an unvarnished examination of the vice president as she tries to embrace the Biden legacy and policies while beginning to chart a path of her own as a presidential candidate.

Women can be heroes. When twenty-year-old nursing student Frances “Frankie” McGrath hears these words, it is a revelation. Raised in the sun-drenched, idyllic world of Southern California and sheltered by her conservative parents, she has always prided herself on doing the right thing. But in 1965, the world is changing, and she suddenly dares to imagine a different future for herself. When her brother ships out to serve in Vietnam, she joins the Army Nurse Corps and follows his path. As green and inexperienced as the men sent to Vietnam to fight, Frankie is overwhelmed by the chaos and destruction of war. Each day is a gamble of life and death, hope and betrayal; friendships run deep and can be shattered in an instant. In war, she meets—and becomes one of—the lucky, the brave, the broken, and the lost. But war is just the beginning for Frankie and her veteran friends. The real battle lies in coming home to a changed and divided America, to angry protesters, and to a country that wants to forget Vietnam. The Women is the story of one woman gone to war, but it shines a light on all women who put themselves in harm’s way and whose sacrifice and commitment to their country has too often been forgotten. A novel about deep friendships and bold patriotism, The Women is a richly drawn story with a memorable heroine whose idealism and courage under fire will come to define an era.",['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91I78fRFUTL._SX522_.jpg'],0,Books > Literature & Fiction > Genre Fiction > Historical,https://www.amazon.com/-/dp/B0C4QD5VPB?_encoding=UTF8&th=1&psc=1&pf_rd_i=desktop&ref_=pd_gw_unk,Audiobook,,,,"{'Listening Length': '14 hours and 57 minutes', 'Author': 'Kristin Hannah', 'Narrator': 'Julia Whelan, Kristin Hannah', 'Whispersync for Voice': 'Ready', 'Audible.com Release Date': 'February 06, 2024', 'Publisher': 'Macmillan Audio', 'Program Type': 'Audiobook', 'Version': 'Unabridged', 'Language': 'English', 'ASIN': 'B0C4QD5VPB', 'Amazon Best Sellers Rank': ""#15 in Audible Books & Originals , #1 in Historical Fiction (Books) , #2 in Family Life Fiction (Audible Books & Originals) , #2 in Women's Fiction (Audible Books & Originals)""}",B0C4QD5VPB,[],{},new,[],"[{'badge': 'Amazon Charts', 'badge_text': '#4 this week'}]",81%,14%,3%,1%,1%

Now, the commanding general—also known as her tough-as-talons mother—has ordered Violet to join the hundreds of candidates striving to become the elite of Navarre: dragon riders. But when you’re smaller than everyone else and your body is brittle, death is only a heartbeat away … because dragons don’t bond to “fragile” humans. They incinerate them. With fewer dragons willing to bond than cadets, most would kill Violet to better their own chances of success. The rest would kill her just for being her mother’s daughter—like Xaden Riorson, the most powerful and ruthless wingleader in the Riders Quadrant.

The shift in kids’ energy and attention from the physical world to the virtual one, Haidt shows, has been catastrophic, especially for girls.”—Michelle Goldberg, The New York Times After more than a decade of stability or improvement, the mental health of adolescents plunged in the early 2010s. Rates of depression, anxiety, self-harm, and suicide rose sharply, more than doubling on many measures. Why? In The Anxious Generation , social psychologist Jonathan Haidt lays out the facts about the epidemic of teen mental illness that hit many countries at the same time. He then investigates the nature of childhood, including why children need play and independent exploration to mature into competent, thriving adults. Haidt shows how the “play-based childhood” began to decline in the 1980s, and how it was finally wiped out by the arrival of the “phone-based childhood” in the early 2010s. He presents more than a dozen mechanisms by which this “great rewiring of childhood” has interfered with children’s social and neurological development, covering everything from sleep deprivation to attention fragmentation, addiction, loneliness, social contagion, social comparison, and perfectionism. He explains why social media damages girls more than boys and why boys have been withdrawing from the real world into the virtual world, with disastrous consequences for themselves, their families, and their societies. Most important, Haidt issues a clear call to action. He diagnoses the “collective action problems” that trap us, and then proposes four simple rules that might set us free. He describes steps that parents, teachers, schools, tech companies, and governments can take to end the epidemic of mental illness and restore a more humane childhood. Haidt has spent his career speaking truth backed by data in the most difficult landscapes—communities polarized by politics and religion, campuses battling culture wars, and now the public health emergency faced by Gen Z. We cannot afford to ignore his findings about protecting our children—and ourselves—from the psychological damage of a phone-based life.

For the last 100,000 years, we Sapiens have accumulated enormous power. But despite all our discoveries, inventions, and conquests, we now find ourselves in an existential crisis. The world is on the verge of ecological collapse. Misinformation abounds. And we are rushing headlong into the age of AI—a new information network that threatens to annihilate us. For all that we have accomplished, why are we so self-destructive? Nexus looks through the long lens of human history to consider how the flow of information has shaped us, and our world. Taking us from the Stone Age, through the canonization of the Bible, early modern witch-hunts, Stalinism, Nazism, and the resurgence of populism today, Yuval Noah Harari asks us to consider the complex relationship between information and truth, bureaucracy and mythology, wisdom and power. He explores how different societies and political systems throughout history have wielded information to achieve their goals, for good and ill. And he addresses the urgent choices we face as non-human intelligence threatens our very existence. Information is not the raw material of truth; neither is it a mere weapon. Nexus explores the hopeful middle ground between these extremes, and in doing so, rediscovers our shared humanity.",['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71J3aTLJfrL._SX522_.jpg'],0,Books > Computers & Technology > Computer Science > AI & Machine Learning > Intelligence & Semantics,https://www.amazon.com/-/dp/B0CT3Y5LL9?_encoding=UTF8&th=1&psc=1&pf_rd_i=desktop&ref_=pd_gw_unk,Audiobook,,,,"{'Listening Length': '17 hours and 28 minutes', 'Author': 'Yuval Noah Harari', 'Narrator': 'Vidish Athavale', 'Whispersync for Voice': 'Ready', 'Audible.com Release Date': 'September 10, 2024', 'Publisher': 'Random House Audio', 'Program Type': 'Audiobook', 'Version': 'Unabridged', 'Language': 'English', 'ASIN': 'B0CT3Y5LL9', 'Amazon Best Sellers Rank': '#28 in Audible Books & Originals , #1 in History of Civilization , #1 in Computer Science (Audible Books & Originals) , #1 in Anthropology (Audible Books & Originals)'}",B0CT3Y5LL9,[],{},new,[],"[{'badge': 'Amazon Charts', 'badge_text': '#2 this week'}]",71%,19%,5%,1%,4%
