Now with Certificate of Authenticity! The reverse side of 2024 1 oz Silver Eagles features the new soaring bald eagle. In this visual, Emily Damstra has captured the bald eagle in the midst of one of its natural activities. Soaring in flight with its wings flexed, the bald eagle clutches a large oak branch in its talons that it no doubt intends to use in the construction of its nest. The obverse (heads) features a refreshed depiction of Adolph A. Weinman's full-length figure of Liberty in full stride, enveloped in folds of the flag, with her right hand extended and branches of laurel and oak in her left. In 2021, the United States Mint returned to its original historical assets to render a closer reflection of Weinman’s original vision that includes the addition of his traditional artist mark that continues to this day. Images are temporary stock photos and will be updated when more images are released from the US Mint.","['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61NQmHQCgiL._SL1200_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61dR5Ko3I4L._SL1200_.jpg']",2,Collectibles & Fine Art > Collectible Coins > Individual Coins,https://www.amazon.com/-/dp/B0CQMSW1BD?_encoding=UTF8&th=1&psc=1&pf_rd_i=desktop&ref_=pd_gw_unk,,,,,"{'Package Dimensions': '3.46 x 2.13 x 0.28 inches; 1.13 ounces', 'Date First Available': 'December 19, 2023', 'Manufacturer': 'US Mint', 'ASIN': 'B0CQMSW1BD', 'Country of Origin': 'USA', 'Amazon Best Sellers Rank': '#1 in Collectible Coins , #1 in Individual Collectible Coins'}",B0CQMSW1BD,[],{},new,[],[],85%,8%,1%,2%,4%
